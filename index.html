		  <p class="info-flex-item">
			Nicholas John Bosa (born October 23, 1997) is an American football defensive end for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Ohio State.
		  </p>
			
		  <p class="info-flex-item">
			Bosa’s father, John, a former
	  member of the Miami Dolphins, encouraged sons Nick and Joey to try other sports like tennis, golf and baseball. However, Nick only had one sport in mind, and he let his parents know it. “Nick threw temper tantrums,” John said. After successfully convincing his parents to let him play football, Nick gave everything he had to the sport. Even as a
	  kid on the field, he wasn’t afraid to speak his mind. Early in his football career, Cheryl watched from the sideline at practice as Nick
	  approached a coach. “I find out later they’d put Nick with the offense,” she recalled. “And he walked up to this guy, totally by himself, tugged on his shirt and said, ‘I don’t want to play offense. I
	  want to play defense.’”
